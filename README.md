- 游꼘**Test your previous programming experience**
- 游꼘**Familiarize yourself with the task assignment procedure**


## 游릴What are you supposed to do in this Task游릴 ?
Inside a GitHub repository, there's a folder named **`src`**. In this folder, you'll find a file named **`main.rs`**, containing **10 functions that act like questions**. Each of these functions returns a single character (currently set to **`x`**).

### Your task is to `modify` these `characters` based on the questions given. Once done, you'll need to push the changes in the remote repository. Our team will then assess the modified answers automatically. Push only changes made inside the `main.rs` file.

## 游린Do NOT change the source code except the return values游린

The Task provided is written in **Rust programming language**. This will help you to get familiar with **the most used programming language on `Solana Blockchain`**. Even though it is **not required** for this task as your assignment is only to change return values, you can **install Rust** with the `link provided below` and get familiar with the workflow connected to programming in this language too.

## 游릴What are you supposed to do in this Task游릴 ?
Inside a GitHub repository, there's a folder named **`src`**. In this folder, you'll find a file named **`main.rs`**, containing **10 functions that act like questions**. Each of these functions returns a single character (currently set to **`x`**).

### Your task is to `modify` these `characters` based on the questions given. Once done, you'll need to push the changes. Our team will then assess the modified answers automatically. Push only changes made inside the `main.rs` file.

#### 游린DO NOT change the source code except the return values. You are responsible for changes that are not meant to be changed

#### 游린DO NOT give any weight to failed GitHub Workflow, this is our setup, your task will be evaluated later.
